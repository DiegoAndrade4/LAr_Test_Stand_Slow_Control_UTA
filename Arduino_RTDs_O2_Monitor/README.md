# Arduino_RTDs_O2_Monitor


This code is intended to read analogic pins,  RTD's and the oxygen sensor. 

See the Monitor_And_Plotting/README.md for complementary information on how the analogic readouts are processed. 





A1 Inner RTDs
A2
A3 

A5 (Jumper) Outer RTD readout from the other arduino board

A7 Oxugen sensor 




If needed, A4 pin can be enabled , there is a resistor to GND in the board from this node.
